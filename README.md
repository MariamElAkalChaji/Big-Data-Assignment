# Big-Data-Assignment

This assignment has been done in collaboration with Ana Karina Ballesteros GÃ³mez and Marina Ortega Angulo.

In this repository, you will find the answer to the Big Data assignment, where we try to develop a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images in patients, whether they have pneumonia or not. 

The dataset was obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and it is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
